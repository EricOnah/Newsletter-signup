Description of process:
Used express here so basic express routing defined.
Added "type: module" to the package.json to use ES6 module syntax.
Because of ES6 module, I need to import  from url and dirname from path to be able to assign the __dirname to the
root folder. This way __dirname is defined and can be used to find the file path when using res.sendFile()

To be able to serve other static files, I import path from path and set the static folder path to be the root folder
without the public folder bc I do not have a public folder in the app.

<app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname)));>

You can also do this without using the path module: Simply use express to render static files in the root folder.
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
It's shorter and easier to understand. Also, you can freely send the html file in the root route without needing to use res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "/signup.html"));

NOTE: Using name attribute to be able to get data from the form using post.

It is faster to use destructuring assignment to get the values of the form fields 

    const { firstName, lastName, email } = req.body;
    console.log(firstName, lastName, email);

To use mailchimp API, we need to set our obj to match mailchimp key-value pairs.
