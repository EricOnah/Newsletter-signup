Description of process:
Used express here so basic express routing defined.
Added "type: module" to the package.json to use ES6 module syntax.
Because of ES6 module, I need to import  from url and dirname from path to be able to assign the __dirname to the
root folder. This way __dirname is defined and can be used to find the file path when using res.sendFile()

To be able to serve other static files, I import path from path and set the static folder path to be the root folder
without the public folder bc I do not have a public folder in the app.

<app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname)));>
